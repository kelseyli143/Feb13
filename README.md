**Instructions on how to use the BMI calculator:**
1. Compile the code in Python

2. The calculator will first ask you if you want to use imperial or metric units. Enter either “imperial” or “metric” when prompted.
* If you chose metric, the calculator will prompt you to enter the height in meters, followed by the weight in kilograms. 
* If you chose imperial, the calculator will prompt you to enter the height is inches, followed by the weight in pounds

3. The calculator will then output:
* the numerical BMI that corresponds with the given height and weight 
* the BMI status (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) depending on the calculated BMI
